Problem 11. Programming Languages
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short 
list with information about the most popular programming languages. 
How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#? Write in a text 
file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 
2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

How do they differ from C#?

C and C# are two different computer programming languages. C# is a multi-paradigm 
programming language. It's based on the C programming language. C was originally 
developed between 1969 and 1973. It has a free-format program source code. 
C# is an object oriented programming language and it's one of the newest programming 
languages. It is a good that this C# becomes a very popular language for a number of 
reasons. One of the key reasons is Microsoft and the promises of .NET.
Microsoft says that C# brings the power of C++ with the ease of Visual Basic. 
Visual Basic is really no easier than programming C#. In fact, you can actually write 
many programs with less code using C#. 

C# was meant to be an advance over both C++ and Java as a general purpose programming 
language. Although it can be argued that some of its features are a step backward, C# 
clearly includes some constructs that move it beyond its predecessors. Although C# 
removes some of the features of C++ that cause programmers a lot of grief, no power 
or functionality was really lost. Some of the programming errors that are easy to 
create in C++ can be totally avoided in C#.  

Another language that has gotten lots of attention is Java. Java, like C++ and C#, 
is based on C. Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, 
strongly, and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed 
with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, both use garbage-collection, 
and both are "curly brace languages" like C and C++. 

There is no sense to compare C # with other languages in that list - like Pearl, 
Delphi, Pascal. They a little bit old-fashioned in my mind. And as we see, their popularity 
is going down very fast...

Ruby is ranked among the top 10 on most of the indices that measure the growth and
popularity of programming languages worldwide. Ruby is a dynamic, open source with 
a focus on simplicity and productivity. Its fans call it a beautiful, artful 
language, which elegant syntax is natural to read and easy to write.

And what about PHP? Most programmers are convinced that PHP is good for small projects 
only, and you can't develop too complex and huge projects with it, but I've read a lot 
of opposing views about that. However, many PHP developers are in sure, that PHP is 
“more open” that C#, because C# is backed by Microsoft where PHP doesn't have 1 single 
huge rich company behind it ... which clearly is a benefit. Of course, it's not in my 
competence to compare languages like these, even when I'm a beginner in programming. 
I will understand more about the differences from C# and other languages, as I start 
to learn them too.
