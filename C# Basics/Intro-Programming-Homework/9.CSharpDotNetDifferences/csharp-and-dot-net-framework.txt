So... The .NET Framework is a software framework that runs primarily on 
Microsoft Windows. It includes a large library and provides language 
interoperability across several programming languages. And C# is only one 
of these languages. Programs written for the .NET Framework execute in a 
software environment, known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), an 
application virtual machine that provides important services such as 
security, memory management, and exception handling. The class library 
and the CLR together constitute the .NET Framework. And also, all
programs, written on the .Net Framework are compilling into an .exe file,
no matter of language (C#, Visual Basic or other).
